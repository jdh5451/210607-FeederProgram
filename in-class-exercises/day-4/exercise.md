# Foo Bar 

You have to print the numbers from 1 to 100.

But for every multiple of 5 print "Foo".

For every multiple of 3 print "Bar". 

For every multiple of both 5 and 3 print "FooBar".

Whenever you print, Foo, Bar or FooBar, you should not print the number. 

## Bonus 

Expand this to be a method that takes in the end number and prints everything up to that point. Adhering to the same aforementioned rules.

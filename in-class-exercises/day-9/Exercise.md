# Putting it all together

## Creating the POJO.
> This can be any new kind of object you desire. Candy, Animal, Food, Car, Music etc. 

- Create and encapsulate at least two data fields in your new class.

- Implement Comparable in your class. 

- Override needed methods from the Object class in your class. 

## Using the POJO

- In another class create a method that searches over a sorted collection of your objects for a target element.
> Bonus- come back to this if you finish: use binary search 

- In a main class create a collection of objects created from your class.

## Making it a game.
- Create new objects based on user input. 

- Check if they exist in the collection already using your search method.

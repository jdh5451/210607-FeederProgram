Write a class named Assignment11 that uses a double for-loop (a for-loop within a for-loop). The outer loop 
should navigate through an integer list  that has 10 elements corresponding to the numbers 1 through 10, 
inclusive. The inner loop should count from 1 to 10, and prints the value of the current count multiplied by the integer value in the list. You should end up printing the multiples of 1 through 10 from 1 to 10. Ex: 1*1, 
1*2, 1*3…1*10, 2*1, 2*2, 2*3…10*9, 10*10.
